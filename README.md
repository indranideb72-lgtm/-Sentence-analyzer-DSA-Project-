# 🧠 Sentence Analyzer (DSA Project)

A Python-based mini project that analyzes any sentence and finds:
- The *most frequent word* 🏆  
- The *number of distinct words*  
- The *frequency of each word*

This project demonstrates the *Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)* concept of *Hash Maps (Dictionaries)* for efficient frequency counting in *O(n)* time.

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts user input text  
- Counts how many times each word appears  
- Displays the most frequent word  
- Shows total distinct word count

## 🧩 DSA Concepts Used
- *Data Structure:* Hash Map (Dictionary)  
- *Algorithm:* Word Frequency Counter  
- *Time Complexity:* O(n)  
- *Space Complexity:* O(n)
